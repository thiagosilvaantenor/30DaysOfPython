## Exceptions Advanced

1. Ask the user for an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive). If the number they give is outside of the specified range, raise a ValueError and inform them that their choice was invalid.

2. Below you'll find a divide function. Write exception handling so that we catch ZeroDivisionError exceptions, TypeError exceptions, and other kinds of ArithmeticError.

   `divide(a, b)
print(a / b)`

3. Below you'll find an itemgetter function that takes in a collection, and either a key or index. Catch any instances of KeyError or IndexError, and write the exception to a file called log.txt, along with the arguments that caused this issue. Once you have written to the log file, reraise the original exception.

   `def itemgetter(collection, identifier):
 return collection[identifier]`
