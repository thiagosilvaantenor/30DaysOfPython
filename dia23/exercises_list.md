# Day 23 - Exercises

1. Write a generator that generates prime numbers in a specified range. You can make use of your solution to exercise 3 from day 8 as a starting point.

2. Below we have an example where map is being used to process names in a list. Rewrite this code using a generator expression.

names = [" rick", " MORTY ", "beth ", "Summer", "jerRy "]
names = map(lambda name: name.strip().title(), names)

3. Write a small program to deal cards for a game of Texas Hold'em. The order of the deal is as follows:

   The deck is shuffled.
   One card is handed to each player in order.
   A second card is handed to each player order.

Then comes the more complicated part of the deal.

    First, the top card of the deck is discarded. This is called the burn.
    Three cards are then placed in the centre of the table, which is called the flop.
    Another card is burned, meaning we discard another card from the top of the deck.
    We add another card to the centre, which is called the turn.
    We burn another card.
    Finally, there's the river, where a fifth and final card is added to the centre.

The desired output for the program is something like this:

How many players are there? 2

Player 1 was dealt: (4, hearts), (4, clubs)
Player 2 was dealt: (9, clubs), (jack, diamonds)

The flop: (jack, clubs), (4, diamonds), (king, spades)
The turn: (8, hearts)
The river: (ace, hearts)

As the example would indicate, the program should accept a variable number of players. There must be at least 2 players, and no more than 10.

After the flop, the turn, and the river there's usually a round of betting, so if you want to extend this exercise, you may want to give the user the option to pause at each of these points.

Hint: We can shuffle cards using the random.shuffle method. This shuffles a sequence in-place, which means it modifies the original sequence. We can then create an iterator from that sequence using iter to make is easy for us to retrieve cards one at a time.
